this will be me speaking about whatever i have going and also try some coding too


so today i created this for a class thing, but once i think about it. i wanted to actually learn how to code in games and maybe test out things in games such as roblox.

i don't want to download anything on here because i know people will hide things in the code to possibly put a RAT in my desktop. So this is why i am here also too learn new things.

this will be me speaking about whatever i have going and also try some coding too


so today i created this for a class thing, but once i think about it. i wanted to actually learn how to code in games and maybe test out things in games such as roblox.

i don't want to download anything on here because i know people will hide things in the code to possibly put a RAT in my desktop. So this is why i am here also too learn new things.

I just wanted to talk about a little experience I had in the cybersecurity. I am currently working at a credit union, at the headquarters.
I talked with my supervisor to see if we can arrange some sort of shadowing day with one of the cybersecurity analyst we have in the back office.
Luckly, I manage to get one. I am not saying names for privacy. It's funny because the day of the scheduled shadowing day. The analyst I was suppose to shadow was on vacation and never told us.
It sucked, but the IT supervisor managed to get me to shadow one of the different analyst that was there. He told me his everyday work that he does. He mainly told me that what he does is just presenting.
He had a little website that I unfortunetly forgot. But It showed many of firewalls that the company had. He told me how it worked, and what he had to do to fix it. But mainly the job I am studying for is just looking at a screen.
That was a little taste of it. He did tell me stories he had to deal with in his career. He told me one of his hardest and difficult thing he had to fix due to someone downloading malware that took over a whole company.
It took him hours to get it fixed. He also told me how he got into it, how he likes to code and play on computer hardware. Cybersecurity is a big demand in todays world as technology gets even more advanced. 
Sadly the shadow had to be cut short since he had to do a presentation and statistics. It sucked but I'm glad I get to have a quick dip into the water and see how things work. From what I remember when he showed me a application.
It showed all of the status's of the firewalls that were up and running. I asked him a question that had me curious. I always saw "Third party cybersecurity has found the card on sale in the dark web" he told me how it worked.
There is a big scan that goes on with each card and it goes all around the web and looks for any matches. Again, it was fun and great to get a insider look into the field and how things work. I hope to do it again.
